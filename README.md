ML - Solar_Panel_Decision_Tree_Python

Python code that I have complied by refering the book **Smarter Decisions - The Intersection of Internet of Things and Decision Science** by **Jojo Moolayil** .

Before getting into the code , here is the brief business understanding .
Africa is known for its remotness and wilderness and setting up power lines, diesel generators and maintaining them in remote areas of the continent is a tough job. Instead by instaliing solar panel in such remote buildings, we can not only power the remote settlementd, but can reduce the maintanence costs by investing only the upfront costs.

In this repository you have the data and code to develop the ML solution for the above business logic.
